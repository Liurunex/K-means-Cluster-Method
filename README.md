- ***Initiate***
	- arbitrarily choose k objects from D as the initial cluster centers; 
- ***Repeat Stpes***
	- reassign/assign each object to the cluster to which the object is the most similar, based on the mean value of the objects in the cluster;
	- update the cluster means, that is, calculate the mean value of the objects for each cluster;
	- until no change; **Terminate Condition**
